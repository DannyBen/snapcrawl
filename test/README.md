SnapCrawl Tests
==================================================

Running Tests
--------------------------------------------------

  # Start a dummy sinatra server
	$ run server start -d

  # Run all tests
  $ run test

  # Stop the server if you are done testing
  $ run server stop


The Fixtures
--------------------------------------------------

The `fixtures` folder contains command line output that was generated by
the tests, and is tested against.

If you are making changes to the server (e.g., adding more endpoints) you may
need to regenerate fixtures. Thankfully, this is easy - simply set 
`@make_fixtures = true` in the `test_bin.rb` test file and run the tests.

**Don't fotget to set it back to false**
