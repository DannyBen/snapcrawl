===============

## Running Tests

	$ cd repo/path
	$ run test
	

## The Test Server

To run tests we need to start a small server to test against.

The `server` folder contains a suitable sinatra server. 

You need to run it before running the tests:

	$ cd server
	$ bundle     # run only once, to install server dependencies
	$ run start --daemon

To stop it:

	$ run stop


## The Fixtures

The `fixtures` folder contains command line output that was generated by
the tests, and is tested against.

If you are making changes to the server (e.g., adding more endpoints) you may
need to regenerate fixtures. Thankfully, this is easy - simply set 
`@make_fixtures = true` in the `test_bin.rb` test file and run the tests.

**Don't fotget to set it back to false**

## Todo

- [ ] Make ths server start/stop automatically when testing
